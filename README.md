# odin-first-web

Create the first web using the knowledge and concepts learnt in The Odin Project.

I'll live the real experience of a web developer, using my own knowledge
and skills to build a website just with the big help of google and my lasts
projects. I'm going be replicating a website given to me in a png file, not
searching fot pixel perfect but for useful and accurate.
